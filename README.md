## GorillaMusicPlayer

A simple mod that lets you play music via ingame ui/menu!

## Installing

So just go to the latest release install the .zip and extract it then drag the unzipped GorillaMusicPlayer folder to your plugins then you take any mp3 you have and put them in the pre-existing Music folder ans then press install/update and boom.

## How to use in-game

When you load into the game you press X on your controller then you should get a mini black menu near your hand it does show instructions but in-case you want to know here is the controls!
A = play | A+Right trigger = next song | A+Left trigger = previous song

## Suggestions

This is my first mod ever published i've just started making mods recently so this mod isnt very good and isnt a 3d model as of right now so forgive me but if you have any suggestions as im hoping to keep this updated and keep making it better as not many of these exist publicly so if you have any just respond to my post on gtag modding group and give me any suggestions!

## License stuff

So if you wanna use any of my bad code lol then go ahead I dont really care tbh.
